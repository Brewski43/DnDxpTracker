Discord Bot for text based D&amp;D5e Campaign

Hello Friends, 

I am trying to learn JS by exploring an idea I had for a Discord I am running.

The goal is to have DMs (admins) type a command like "!give{player}{x}xp" 

The players will all start with 900xp (level 3 in 5e) 

When the command is entered, the bot will log the xp for the player by adding it to their pool. When their xp reaches the next level threshold I would like the bot to message the player and say "Congratulations {player} your character has risen to level {y}!"
